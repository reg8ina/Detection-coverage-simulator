# Detection Coverage Simulator

## Project Overview
This project is a Detection Coverage Simulator.
It demonstrates how attacker behavior maps to observable signals
and how detection coverage can be evaluated without executing real 
attacks.

The project is analytical in nature and focuses on detection logic,
coverage gaps, and defender visibility rather than infrastructure or 
malware.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Behavior-based attack scenarios
- Detection coverage evaluation
- Mapping attack steps to observable signals
- CLI-oriented design (future implementation)

### Out of Scope
- SOC cloud labs or infrastructure
- Real malware or ransomware execution
- Exploit development
- Blocking or prevention mechanisms
